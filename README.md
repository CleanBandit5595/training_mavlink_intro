Mavlink and Ardupilot Introduction training exercise

In this exercise you will learn about the wonders of ardupilot, mavlink and the drone's hobbiest community! 

A silly lady Amy and her friend Tammy wants to fly a drone. 
They look on the internet and find that ardupilot is a firmware running on pixhawk which supposedly should help them fly drones. 

While they wait for their drone to arrive from AliExpress, they want to check the firmware on some simulation on their pc. 

Remember! Amy and Tammy are not SW engineeers nor even mechanics engineer, they are just two hobbiests starting to get into the drones world. 

They are enthusiastics and quick learners with an eager desire to learn this world, and they have the whole **World Wide Web** in the palm of their hand. 

You are now inside Amy and Tammy's shoes, Enjoy! 


## Phase 1: 

1. Install gcs (ground control station) to command your drone. This link might help you - https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-install-gcs.html

2. Install sitl (software in the loop) to simulate the ardupilot software in an emulator. This link might help you - https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html

3. Run the drone in sitl and connect your gcs to it (you're a big girl now, you don't need another help links). 

4. Takeoff your drone, and set it to go **autonomously** to another location on the map. 

5.  Answer the following questions and complete the next tasks using the GCS and the internet (Do not make use of Mavproxy yet, you'll learn about it in just  a minute) - 

    Which mode did you change to? Was there any problem taking off / go to another location? 

    Change the height at which the drone goes to another location. 

    Name 4 modes of the copter and understand their meaning!
